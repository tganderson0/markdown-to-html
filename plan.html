<h1> Phase 0: Requirements Specification (10%)
</h1><p>I will be writing a calculator using vanilla javascript, adding all elements solely through javascript and not using an html document. (Other than the most basic valid page that I can)
</p><ol><li> Title of page should be changed by the script upon load
</li><li> Div will contain instructions to create an expression, as well as inputs for creating one
</li><ul><li> Numeric inputs for binary arithmetic operations (has a placeholder value to begin)
</li><li> Drop down menu to select operation to perform
</li><ol><li> +
</li><li> -
</li><li> /
</li><li> *
</li><li> %
</li><li> **
</li></ol></ul><ul><li> Input for color lets user pick the output div's color
</li><li> Button with label 'compute', which will then evaluate input and output a new div below the input interface (NOTE: color will be taken from input) Should verify input before evaluating
</li></ul><li> Newest output should be at the TOP, pushing the older ones downward
</li></ol><h3> Output format
</h3><ul><li> String representation of the current time of evaluation, regardless of operation success
</li><li> Output div should be REMOVED when CLICKED
</li><li> Red output div if there is an error, place error message
</li><li> Color should be what was picked if operation was successful
</li></ul><h3> What I know and what I will need to learn
</h3><ul><li> Already know how to create elements through javascript, the main one I will need to look into is telling which div was clicked, but if memory serves me right, there is some form of click listener that I can use
</li><li> Will need to review how to use the 'color' input
</li></ul><h1> Phase 1: System Analysis (10%)
</h1><h3> Inputs
</h3><ol><li> Inputted numeric value 1 (numeric input)
</li><li> Inputted numeric value 2 (numeric input)
</li><li> Selected operation (drop-down selector)
</li><li> Output div color (color selector)
</li><li> Output div that was clicked
</li><li> Compute button clicked
</li><li> Current time of browser (from js)
</li></ol><h3> Outputs
</h3><ol><li> New div according to design (red for error, their color for other)
</li><li> Removal of a output div if clicked
</li><li> No formulae, can just use eval()
</li></ol><h1> Phase 2: Design (30%)
</h1><p>Deliver:
</p><p>(Pseudocode in python-ish)
</p><div class="code_block"><code><br># numericX is the input sliders, operation is the currently selected operation
<br># This will be used to validate input, as well as creating the text content for the the divs
<br># Note: I originally had this function checking for divide by 0 errors, but it seems javascript is totally cool with it
<br>def evaluateInputs(numeric1, numeric2, operation): --> Returns a tuple, string with result or error message, along with boolean if operation was successful
<br><br># Bad inputs
<br>if numeric1 is null or numeric2 is null:
<br>return ("Error! One of more Operands are missing", false)
<br>if numeric1 is not numeric or numeric2 is not numeric:
<br>return ("Error! One or or more Operands are not valid inputs - you dirty hacker")
<br><br># Inputs are good
<br>result = eval(numeric1, operation, numeric2)
<br>return (f"{numeric1} {operation} {numeric2} = {result}", true)
<br><br><br># values are the same as evaluateInputs, but the color is the color they selected with the input
<br># Used for actually creating the divs, creates the correct color as well
<br>def createOutput(numeric1, numeric2, operation, color): --> Creates and returns a div with the proper form
<br><br>output = div() # Create a div, obviously this will be javascript rather than python in implementation
<br><br>outputText, valid = evaluateInputs(numeric1, numeric2, operation)
<br><br>output.text = f"{currentTime} {outputText}"
<br>if valid:
<br>output.color = color
<br>else:
<br><br>output.color = red
<br><br>return output
<br><br></code></div><p>Good and bad inputs are handled by the functions, including if the user does some hackery with changing the input types.
</p><p>Created a separate html file for getting the designs down, to reference later
</p><h1> Phase 3: Implementation (15%)
</h1><p>I realized that the plan could have gone a bit better with the functions, I did not think about the click listeners. I ended up creating 2 extra functions, that pretty much just added the original input, as well as a single output box.
</p><h1> Phase 4: Testing & Debugging (30%)
</h1><h2> Tested
</h2><ol><li> Empty input box on one or both should create a red error output
</li><ul><li> PASSED
</li></ul><li> Extra test, if user changes input type to non-numeric, and enters a non-numeric value, should output red error
</li><ul><li> PASSED
</li></ul><li> Output box should match color input
</li><ul><li> PASSED
</li></ul><li> Output order should be newest to oldest
</li><ul><li> PASSED
</li></ul><li> Output should be removed when clicked, and the correct one should be removed
</li><ul><li> PASSED
</li></ul><li> Proper output for each selection (perform each operation on a set of numbers, should match expected output)
</li><ul><li> PASSED
</li></ul><li> Testing one and both negative outputs expected number
</li><ul><li> PASSED
</li></ul><li> Testing one and both very small numbers gives expected output
</li><ul><li> PASSED
</li></ul><li> Testing one and both very large numbers gives expected output
</li><ul><li> PASSED
</li></ul></ol><h1> Phase 5: Deployment (5%)
</h1><p>Deliver:
</p><ul><li> Your repository pushed to GitLab.
</li></ul><h1> Phase 6: Maintenance
</h1><p>Deliver:
</p><ul><li> What parts of your program are sloppily written and hard to understand?
</li><li> Creation of the element functions could have been organized a lot better, as well as eliminating some redundancies
</li></ul><ul><li> Are there parts of your program which you aren’t quite sure how/why they work?
</li><li> The program all made sense, it is pretty much just like the first assignments of GUIs, with slightly different syntax for doing things
</li></ul><ul><li> If a bug is reported in a few months, how long would it take you to find the cause?
</li><li> Bugs should be really quick to find, as it is a very short and simple program. Not a large amount of connected parts
</li></ul><ul><li> Will your documentation make sense to
</li><p>anybody besides yourself?
</p><ul><li> The documentation needs a bit of work to be better understood by other people, I plan on going back and making it better after I finish answering these questions.
</li></ul><ul><li> How easy will it be to add a new feature to this program in a year?
</li><li> New features would be really easy to add, as I feel I separated the sections out approriately. The setup function handles adding original parts to the page on load, everything else is just a function to create an element
</li></ul></ul><ul><li> Will your program continue to work after upgrading your computer’s hardware? the operating system? to the next version of Python?
</li><li> Since this is javascript running in my browser, my computer's hardware and the operating system would not have an effect on my program. I don't take advantage of anything specific to a computer either. For the next version of javascript, it should be fine, since I did not use any deprecated functions, although I can't gurantee that my work will last forever, just at least to the next version
</li></ul>
